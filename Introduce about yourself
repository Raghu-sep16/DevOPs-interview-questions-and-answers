I almost have 7 years experience as software engineer, my relevant experience in DevOps is 3 years, 
In my intial stage as devops engineer,I worked on jenkins CI CD pipeling, maven as build tool, 
git as a source code management or version control tool and sonarq later I started working on anisble as a configuration tool,
terraform as infrastucture configuration and Coming to containerization and orchestration using docker and kubernetes, 
even I am expertise on cloud technologies like AWS, Azure, GKE

Day to day activities:
